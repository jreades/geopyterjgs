## Reviewer #1: 

The paper presents some details on Geopyter, a hub for the distribution of contents in computational and spatial analytic instruction. It shows the design of the system and explains the types of innovative workflows that it enables for lecturers. I believe the effort is very promising and having the paper to both explain and advertise the initiative is worthy of publication by JGSY. However, I believe there are some points that can improve the contribution of the paper, as follows.

1.	On page 4, line 21, please write in full the acronym MOOC.
2.	On page 5, the authors try to explain what they call Atoms, Sessions and Modules. The differentiation between these is however not very clear at this point. I suggest maybe adding a box to better explain what each of these elements is and how they differ.
3.	On page 6, line 45, the paper explains how to select only parts of an Atom. The example with 'a.super' doesn't really deliver a good explanation, since it is not really clear what this class is. A more extensive example may be more helpful.
4.	Actually, to have a full Jupyter notebook as an example, with print-screens may be a good idea to achieve the objective of addressing the "the cohort of teachers at all levels" (p.11). On page 7, the authors present an example of how to include an Atom in a Session. However, for a teacher at a beginner level, it may not be clear where/how that code is supposed to be inserted. Hence, I believe having a full notebook as example would really be more helpful to achieve the beginner level of teachers.
In my opinion, this is the greatest weakness of the paper: not showing a full example that can be used by beginners to build upon it and from there start creating their own Sessions with a mixing approach as proposed by the authors. I strongly suggest the addition of a full example to the paper.
5.	The url used for the include examples takes the reader to a BlueHost advertising page. The authors should change it.
6.	The authors mention that as the user base grows, so will the contributor base and from there a cumulative circular causation would start operating to increase the platform. I remain, however, in doubt of how Geopyter will be able to organise all this varying mix of contents and keep all of it following standard patterns of coding, documentation, etc. It would be interesting to know how this is planned.

In sum, I believe the initiative, and hence the paper, is very interesting. However, I am not confident the paper can, as it currently stands, be of much help to beginning lecturers as it proposes. Some work on it is required in order to achieve this.

## Reviewer #2: 

This manuscript introduces a novel and innovative instructional system that integrates code with instructional material in mix-and-matchable Jupyter Notebooks. The manuscript is well written, but does have a few sections that mix technical concepts with domain concepts, for example. This is a useful contribution to the literature and with some minor changes is publishable. I added more detailed comments below.

How does Open Education Resources (OER) factor into this work? This is a growing movement in the education space and intersects with OSS and MOOCs as well. The authors should consider discussing this as related work.

Abstract
The abstract is clearly written and spells out the motivation and purpose of Geopyter.

Introduction
P1l14 - I would recommend removing the 'online' qualifier and reference simply teaching of these technologies.
Pl15 - This is a jarring pivot that readers may not fully follow. Readers without a background in data science may not know that there is an 'open' ethos nor what an 'open' ethos entails. So a brief 1-sentence introduction for these topics may be useful.
I would recommend that the introduction introduce and cite Jupyter Notebooks.

Statement of Need
This section succinctly outlines the need.

Origins and Inspirations
P2l12 - This first paragraph mixes curriculum with software. It would be helpful to disentangle these two elements while also describing their interrelationships.
P2l48 - space missing after Rey 2019 citation, the citation is the incorrect style.
P2l50 - wrong citation style
P3l16 - e.g., should be before the citation
P3l29 - the authors may consider broadening the quote to say something like: 'computational social/environmental/geospatial scientist' to make it more inclusive to a broader readership
P3l34 - speed can also be an issue in these cases.
P5l4 - An introduction of Git and Github would be helpful for readers that don't have a lot of experience with them.

Figure 1. This is a nice solution. The ability to test notebooks using the Markdown header hierarchy is very elegant.

Use Cases
P8l22 - Define HE
The descriptions in the use cases are clear. However, it would be nice to see a more specific use case with actual materials in addition to these broader discussion use cases.
The rest of the manuscript summarizes the key points and extensions. I was happy to see the potential connection to other projects such as the Body of Knowledge.

## Reviewer #3: 

Fascinating to see how the development of this resource came about, and how its design aims to fill in a niche discovered within the teaching of spatial analytics. I was intrigued by the idea that this could connect the streams from the FOSS and MOOC movements, as the abstract pointed towards, but found myself not completely understanding how this fit in that trajectory after all in the sections describing the process. I believe a better historical grounding with actual telling of timelines and developments in those powerful movements would have situated this GeoPyTeR story more strongly. That said, this design narrative seems a bit smoothed over. It omits reflection on some of the challenges, and glosses over what might be a good opportunity to reveal what might be remaining or conquered flaws, false starts, wheel-reinventing, or other elements that surely hold some insights for audience of this journal. Not being a developer, I had a hard time following some
of the heavy jargon in many spots that might only need some signposts to reach a broader community of interest. It is important to identify the "instructors" audience more clearly: I am assuming that this is for university faculty teaching to undergraduates / graduates at mostly US / European institutions, but if that assumption is wrong, that underscores the need for the author to make that explicit. The introduction should start with the problem and purpose. Two other brief mentions seem missed opportunities: the reference to "best practices" and reference to the Body of Knowledge, which seem could catapult uptake of such a resource. Finally, it surprised me that the use case scenarios were only "potential use" and not actual end-user cases. This led me to wonder who is using the resource in what actual context? How many? where? for which content? for which students? Does it rise to the usage potential with MOOCs and reach a massive audience? would some of the pitfalls of
MOOCs befall this resource as well or not? How might some of the chalelnges of the open movement be resolved or remain? This also reveals how the article is devoid of time and timelines, which would orient the reader.
